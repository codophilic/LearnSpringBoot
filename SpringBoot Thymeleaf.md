- Thymeleaf is a Java template engine for processing and creating HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS and text.
- Thymeleaf in Spring Boot is a template engine used to generate dynamic web pages. Think of it as a tool that helps your application create HTML pages that can change based on the data it has.
- Thymeleaf allows you to insert data into HTML pages. For example, if you want to show a user's name on a webpage, Thymeleaf can take the name from your application and put it into the right spot in the HTML. It works smoothly with Spring Boot, meaning it can easily access and use the data that your application manages, like user information, product details, etc.
