## SpringBoot Security vs Spring Security

- **Spring Security** handles authentication (verifying who you are) and authorization (what you are allowed to do) for your application. It provides tools and configurations to secure your application, such as login mechanisms, role-based access control, and protection against common vulnerabilities.
- **Spring Boot Security** provides default configurations and auto-setup for security using Spring Security. It simplifies the process of securing your application by automatically setting up basic security features, so you don’t have to manually configure everything from scratch. When you create a new Spring Boot application and add Spring Security, it automatically sets up basic security (like requiring a login) without you having to manually configure every detail.
- **Spring Security**: Requires manual setup and configuration of security features. You’ll write and configure security-related code yourself.
- **Spring Boot Security**: Automatically configures security settings for you based on default settings and conventions. You can still customize it further if needed.
